# RTCC alarm interrupt

This example application shows how to use the RTCC to configure the time and generate the alarm.

## Description

This example application shows how to setup RTCC time and configure alarm using the RTCC Peripheral Library. The application sets up an alarm to be generated every day at a specified time. A message is sent via the Virtual COM port on the alarm trigger.

### Setting up [PIC32MK GP Development Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/dm320106)

- Connect micro USB cables from the J12(Debug USB) and J25(USB-to-UART) connectors on the board to the computer

### Setting up PIC32MK MCJ Curiosity Pro Board

- Connect micro USB cable to the 'USB Debug' connector on the board to the computer

### Setting up PIC32MK MCM Curiosity Pro Board

- Connect micro USB cable to the 'USB Debug' connector on the board to the computer
- Connect the USB to UART port (J400) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Console output will be as given below, after the alarm is triggered:

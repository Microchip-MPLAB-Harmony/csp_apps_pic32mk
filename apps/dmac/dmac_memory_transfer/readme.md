# DMAC memory transfer

This example application demonstrates how to use the DMAC peripheral to do a memory to memory transfer.

## Description

The application uses a software trigger to initiate a memory-memory transfer from the source buffer to the destination buffer with 16-bit beat size and 32-bit beat size. Transfer status is reported on console.

## Downloading and building the application

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Following message is output on console:

   ![output](images/output_dmac_memory_transfer.png)

5. The LED indicates the success or failure:
   - The LED is turned ON when the DMAC memory transfer is successful

Following table provides LED names:

# ADCHS Interrupt

This example application shows how to sample an analog input using the ADCHS peripheral and displays the converted samples on a serial terminal.

## Description

In this application, an analog input is converted by a hardware trigger generated by the TMR peripheral. Result is read in the conversion complete interrupt handler. Converted digital value is displayed on the serial terminal.

## Downloading and building the application

### Setting up [PIC32MK GP Development Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/dm320106)

- Connect the AN3 pin RB1 (Pin 15 of the J8) to the Vcc (Pin 7 of the J31)
- Connect the Debug USB port (J12) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Connect the USB to UART port (J25) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Setting up PIC32MK MCJ Curiosity Pro Board

- Connect the AN3 pin RB1 (Pin 6 of the J502) to the Vcc (Pin 20 of the J502)
- Connect the Debug USB port (J1) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable (This will enumerate the virtual COM port)

### Setting up PIC32MK MCM Curiosity Pro Board

- Connect the AN0 pin RA0 (Pin 0 of the J300) to the Vcc (Pin 7 of the J300)
- Connect the Debug USB port (J500) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Connect the USB to UART port (J400) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Console displays the ADC count and the ADC input voltage
